 IoT-Resource-Management
 This project implements an **IoT-based Smart Resource Management System** to optimize task scheduling, power efficiency, and data synchronization in IoT devices. It features a **Scheduling Module** (priority-based task execution), **Power Management Module** (DVFS, sleep modes), and **Data Synchronization Module** (MQTT/CoAP protocols, buffering). Built with **C/C++** and designed for RTOS like FreeRTOS, the system ensures real-time performance, extended battery life, and reliable data transfer in constrained environments. Future enhancements include ML-driven adaptive management and advanced protocols.
